    "Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of computer science and artificial intelligence (AI) that uses machine learning to enable computers to understand and communicate with human language. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What are its applications?\n",
    "\n",
    "Finance: In financial dealings, nanoseconds might make the difference between success and failure when accessing data, or making trades or deals. NLP can speed the mining of information from financial statements, annual and regulatory reports, news releases or even social media.\n",
    "\n",
    "Healthcare: New medical insights and breakthroughs can arrive faster than many healthcare professionals can keep up. NLP and AI-based tools can help speed the analysis of health records and medical research papers, making better-informed medical decisions possible, or assisting in the detection or even prevention of medical conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Insurance: NLP can analyze claims to look for patterns that can identify areas of concern and find inefficiencies in claims processingâ€”leading to greater optimization of processing and employee efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Legal: Almost any legal case might require reviewing mounds of paperwork, background information and legal precedent. NLP can help automate legal discovery, assisting in the organization of information, speeding review and helping ensure that all relevant details are captured for consideration.\n"
